# GenAI_Project-
This project presents a novel approach to integrating Generative AI with VLSI circuit design, to automate and optimize CMOS architectures using prompt engineering techniques. Developed in Python, the system intelligently generates, evaluates, and visualizes logic gates, by combining principles of digital electronics with AI-driven strategies.
By leveraging machine learning models such as GANs and Transformers, we aim to reduce manual effort, minimize design errors, and achieve efficient hardware implementations.


**Objectives:**
Design an AI-based system capable of generating or optimizing CMOS circuits.
Apply generative models (e.g., GANs, LLMs) for intelligent VLSI design automation.
Evaluate the generated circuits based on Efficiency, Power, and Area (EPA) metrics.

**Methodology:**

1. Dataset: CMOS circuits & SPICE netlists.
2. Frameworks: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
3. AI Models: GANs, Transformers, fine-tuned LLMs.
4. Validation Tools: LTSpice, Cadence, MATLAB.
5. Evaluation Metrics: Gate count, propagation delay, power consumption.

**Expected Outcomes**

1. AI-assisted prototype model for generating CMOS circuits (e.g., inverters, subsystems).
2. Reduced design time and complexity in VLSI workflows.
3. Improved circuit efficiency with automated optimization.

**Applications & Impact**

1. EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools.
2. Low-power IoT systems and ASIC/FPGA prototyping.
3. Enhanced automation in consumer electronics and biomedical devices.


**Challenges & Mitigation**
Lack of dataset.
To create a code based circuit on the primitive languages as VHDL and LTSpice, gathering information regarding all that is a challenge.

**Future Scope**

1. Expanding to BiCMOS, PMOS, and NMOS designs.
2. Developing a full AI-driven VLSI design suite.
3. Integration with cloud-based EDA platforms for scalability.
4. Creating a new AI driven circuit based environment, to reduce the use of sources.
5. Better Simulation Programs.
