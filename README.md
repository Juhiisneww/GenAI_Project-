# GenAI_Project-
This project presents a novel approach to integrating Generative AI with VLSI circuit design, to automate and optimize CMOS architectures using prompt engineering techniques. Developed in Python, the system intelligently generates, evaluates, and visualizes logic gates, by combining principles of digital electronics with AI-driven strategies.
